          <h4><b>History</b></h4>
          <p>By the late 12th century, the Cambridge region already had a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation, due to monks from the nearby bishopric church of Ely.</p><p> However, it was an incident at Oxford which is most likely to have formed the establishment of the university: two Oxford scholars were hanged by the town authorities for the death of a woman, without consulting the ecclesiastical authorities, who would normally take precedence (and pardon the scholars) in such a case, but were at that time in conflict with King John.</p><p>Currently the squad trains three times a week at the University Sports Centre. The University of Oxford went into suspension in protest, and most scholars moved to cities such as Paris, Reading, and Cambridge.</p>
